description: 'The Big Store sells everything from stationary to room decor, the identity is very fun, very organic and playful, our main focus was to deliver that through not only the logo but packaging as well, the logo has a relatively simple design but the rest of the branding is very heavy on illustration and it all has a very organic hand-drawing look to them to further give it that playful look. this also gives the brand more freedom to expand on their illustrations collection in the future, any future illustration or even typeface would look good with the identity as long as it has that red or blue hand-drawn effect.'
