description: 'branding for Saudi brand MS perfumes, Client wanted a simple typographic letters in a San Serif font for a logo, and a simple black and gold color palette. the brand currently has 3 main scents - as represented in the photos- we were limited in budget for photography and had only single white shots of the perfumes so all social media posters bellow were photoshop manipulation of 3 single photos of the perfumes. the design not only included the logo but everything from packaging to selecting the perfume bottles to the Thank you cards.'
